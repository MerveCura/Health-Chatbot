Knee pain can have many causes such as overuse, minor strains, or irritation after activity. For safe self-care, reduce high-impact movements for a short time, keep the knee gently moving without pushing into pain, and avoid deep bending if it worsens symptoms. Using rest breaks, light stretching, and supportive footwear may help, and you can apply a cool pack briefly after activity if it feels irritated. If pain is severe, swelling increases, walking becomes difficult, or it does not improve, it is a good idea to see a doctor.
